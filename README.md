        'sudo lsof +D /dev/bus/usb'

    * suunto/usb-serial-simple kernel driver attaches automatically to ANT USB in latest linux kernels
        fixed by blacklisting it in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, or dynamically by 'sudo rmmod suunto'/'sudo rmmod usb-serial-simple'

    * Tracing usb traffic/packets on bus 4

       'cat /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon/4u'
